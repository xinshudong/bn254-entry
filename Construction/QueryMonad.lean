This file defines the free query monad the Plan B oracle programs are written in, and its
translation into the challenge's indexed `Cryptography.QueryProgram`.

The challenge's `QueryProgram oracle Result budget` carries its query bound in its type. Plan B's
programs are loops over lanes, chunks, switches and elements whose per-iteration budgets differ
(the last chunk is narrower, the four lanes carry different element counts, the evaluator skips
its active entries), so writing them directly at a fixed index would thread a budget equation
through every combinator. Instead they are written in `FreeQuery`, the same syntax without the
index, and their bound is a separate proposition `FreeQuery.Bounded program budget`: every path
through the program makes at most `budget` queries. `FreeQuery.toProgram` turns a bounded free
program into the indexed one, and `eval_toProgram` says the two interpret identically.

Nothing here is specific to Plan B.
