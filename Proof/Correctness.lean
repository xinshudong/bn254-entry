This file is the Plan B correctness root (plan
`2026-09-17-planB.md`, Task 21).

`PerfectCorrectness` quantifies over **every** security parameter, scalar, tape and input --
there is no "with overwhelming probability" anywhere in it -- and Plan B meets it
structurally (plan D.9):

* no working modulus and no `Z_M` wraparound: every wire is `F_p` and every gate is
  `F_p`-linear, so the one-hot fold `sum_j iota(j) * L_j` is an identity, not an estimate;
* the switch-resolution order is a function of the evaluator's cleartext input alone;
* off-curve inputs are refused *before* the garbled program is touched --
  `Pipeline.evaluate` runs `decodePoint` on the cleartext affine input and returns `none`,
  which `Garbling.evaluate` reports as `some none`. That branch is deterministic and
  tape-independent;
* the two Jacobian degeneracies (`Z = 0` with `X = Y = 0`, and the doubling exception) go
  through the unchanged exception gadget, whose entry is a deterministic function of the tape
  and the input;
* the two switch systems deliver exactly `a_e * coord + K e` for every tape, by
  `PlanB.delivers` (`Proof/Correctness/PGS/Row.lean`), so nothing about the delivery is
  conditional either.
