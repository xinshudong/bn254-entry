This file discharges the projectivized garbling scheme's delivery hypothesis (plan
`2026-09-17-planB.md`, Task 20, step 2).

`Construction` may not import `Proof`, so `Construction/ArgoMAC/Pipeline.lean` states the fact
that the switch systems deliver `slope * coordinate + offset` as a named `Prop`,
`Pipeline.Delivers`, whose statement is character for character `evalCoord_garbleCoord`. Here
it is supplied, for every tape and every one of the four lanes at once. With it,
`Pipeline.evaluateEncoded` and `Garbling.evaluateEncodeRows` become unconditional: the 824
values the evaluator obtains are exactly the `a_e * coord + K e` the row layer expects.

/-- **The delivery hypothesis, discharged.** For every fixed-key oracle, every lane, every
free-XOR label family and every slope vector, the evaluator's fold of that lane's switch
system returns the element's slope times the coordinate, offset by the garbler's own output
mask `O[e]`. -/
