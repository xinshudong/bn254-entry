Phase 3 glue, step 1 (note C, T01): **the randomness split.**

A Plan B tape `Garbling.Randomness` is exactly a pair (private coins, public oracle):

* the oracle half is `(fixedKeyOracle, encPRFOracle, hashOracle)` -- `Scheme.Oracle`, i.e.
  `PublicOracle PlanB.FixedIndex EncPRF.PermutationIndex`;
* the coin half is every other field -- `Scheme.Coins`, the challenge's `Solution.Randomness`.

`splitCoins` is that equivalence (its inverse is the construction's own `Coins.withOracle`), and
`uniform_split` transports the uniform tape law through it: a uniform tape is a uniform coin
followed by an independent uniform oracle. The marginals `uniform_tapeOracle` (the challenge's
`StandardAssumptions` form) and `uniform_tapeCoins` follow.

Every statement takes its `Fintype` instances as arguments, so it applies at the
`Fintype.ofFinite` instances `Solution.adaptivePrivacy` installs; nothing here computes a
cardinality (the permutation families have `(2^128)!`-sized factors).
