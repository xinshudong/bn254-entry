**Phase 3, P1f — generic: a view-preserving symmetry bounds a guess.**

`guess_le_of_symmetry`: let `μ` be a law on `Ω`, `view` and `stat` two observations, and
`act : G → Ω → Ω` a finite family of `μ`-preserving maps that fix the view. If, from every `ω`, at
most one `g` moves `stat` onto a given value `x`, then

```
#G · μ{view = v ∧ stat = x}  ≤  μ{view = v},
```

i.e. `stat` hits `x` with conditional mass at most `1/#G`. Every guessing bound of hop (1) is this
statement, at a symmetry of the swapped tape that fixes the adversary's view and moves one hidden
quantity (a garbler point, a garbler output, the bridge key).
