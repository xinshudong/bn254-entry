**Phase 3, P1k — run tools for the per-shadow bounds, and the EncPRF part after `HW`'s opening.**

Generic tools for P4's refill runner and the lazy runner:

* `runRefill_bind_mem` — a refill run of a sequence passes through a run of its first part;
* `runRefill_invariant` — a state invariant kept by every question of a program (`AllQ`) is kept by
  the refill run; `runRefill_enc_same`: a program asking no EncPRF question keeps the EncPRF part;
* `runLazyQ_stores` — a lazy run stores its path and returns its value;
* `runLazyQ_potential` — a potential that no question of a program raises in expectation is a
  supermartingale along the lazy run.

The EncPRF part after `HW`'s opening (`opening_encExact`): the opening's only EncPRF questions are
the 508 bit-`false` whitening pads at the prefix's key `k₁`, so its final state stores exactly the
inputs `0 ⊕ k₁` at every position (`EncExact`), with `k₁` the key the evaluator's prefix reads
there. The designated installation keeps it (`programAllSkip_enc`).
