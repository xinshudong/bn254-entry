**Phase 3, P1i — (B), part 1: a flag of a flagged private run is a touch of the unflagged final state.**

The middle game `M'` runs its private stage 2 through flagged runners (`runLazyQFlag`,
`runRefillFlag`, `runFillFlag`, `programAllSkipFlag`): each stops (`none`) at the first question or
program that touches the stage-1 state `σ₁` (`FullTouch`). For the flag mass we compare each with
its **unflagged** run (the same runner against the empty planted state) and charge a flag to the
event that the unflagged run's **final** private state *meets* `σ₁` — some pair of `σ₁` shares an
input or an output with a stored pair of the final state (`Touches σ₁ (pointsOf final)`, P1d's
union-bound event). Nothing is lost:

* a touching question stores the pair it touches with (`query_touch`, `program_touch`);
* a lazy run, a program and every runner only **grow** the state (`Grows`, `query_grows`,
  `program_grows`), and meeting `σ₁` is monotone in growth (`touches_grows`).

`runLazyQFlag_le`: for continuation weights `F ≤ G` with `G` saturated on states that meet `σ₁`,
the flagged run weighted by `F` (a flag weighs `1`) is below the unflagged run weighted by `G`.
