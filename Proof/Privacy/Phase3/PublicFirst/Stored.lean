**Phase 3, P1i — stored paths: a run stores the path it takes, and a re-run of a stored path is
deterministic.**

`StoredPath state P`: every question on `P`'s path, read from `state` (`answerOf`), is stored in
`state` with that answer. It survives growth, with the same value (`storedPath_grows`), and on it a
lazy re-run of `P` returns `P`'s value without sampling or changing the state
(`runLazyQ_storedPath`).

`runRefill_storedPath`: P4's refill run of a program none of whose questions is intercepted ends
in a state that stores its path, and returns the path's value. With `openingQueriesM_eq_prefix`,
after `HW`'s opening the evaluator's prefix (system A and the bridge hash) is stored
(`opening_stores_prefix`), so the on-curve shadow's re-run of the prefix reads the opening's keys.
